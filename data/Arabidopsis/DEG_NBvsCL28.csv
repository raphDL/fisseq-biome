It appears to primarily act as an exochitinase in vitro where it predominantly cleaves a chitobiose (GlcNAc)2 residue from the non-reducing end of a chitin oligosaccharide. However, it shows some minor endochitinase activity in vitro, as well. A putative 24 amino-acid signal peptide may direct this protein to the secretory system and it has been detected in cell wall apoplastic fluid. RT-PCR experiments demonstrate that ChiC transcript levels are increased in response to abscisisc acid, jasmonic acid, and NaCl stress. Microarray results also suggest that transcript levels rise in response to osmotic stress, two fungal pathogens, a bacterial pathogen, and the elicitor flagellin.

Thalian-diol and desaturated thalian-diol are lost from the root extracts of thah1-1 mutants. Overexpression of the sequence from At5g48000.1 rescues the thah1-1 mutant phenotype (Field 2008); it is unknown whether the shorter sequences associated with other gene models would provide functional complementation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JAZ1 transcript levels rise in response to a jasmonate stimulus. JAZ1 can interact with the COI1 F-box subunit of an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase in a yeast-two-hybrid assay only in the presence of jasmonate-isoleucine (JA-ILE) or coronatine. Application of jasmonate methyl ester to Arabidopsis roots reduces the levels of a JAZ1:GUS fusion protein, presumably  by stimulating ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation. The Jas domain appears to be important for JAZ1-COI1 interactions in the presence of coronatine. Two positive residues (R205 and R206) in the Jas domain shown to be important for coronatine -dependent COI1 binding are not required for binding AtMYC2. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.,,,,,,,,,,,,

CEP1 was also released to the tapetal cell wall during late stage 6 and stage 7. After the tapetal cell wall degenerated, the CEP1 enzyme entered the callose wall from the degenerated tapetal cell wall and was probably involved in degeneration of the callose wall.,,,,,,,,,,,
