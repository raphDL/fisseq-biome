ELIPs are thought not to be directly involved in the synthesis and assembly of specific photosynthetic complexes, but rather affect the biogenesis of all chlorophyll-binding complexes. A study (PMID 17553115) has shown that the chlorophyll synthesis pathway was  downregulated as a result of constitutive ELIP2 expression, leading to decreased chlorophyll availability for the assembly  of pigment-binding proteins for photosynthesis.

THAH appears to add a hydroxyl group to the triterpene thalianol. thah1 mutants have an elevated accumulation of thalianol. thah1-1 mutants have longer roots than wild type plants. Thalian-diol and desaturated thalian-diol are lost from the root extracts of thah1-1 mutants. Overexpression of the sequence from At5g48000.1 rescues the thah1-1 mutant phenotype (Field 2008); it is unknown whether the shorter sequences associated with other gene models would provide functional complementation.

Overexpression of THAS leads to dwarfing in the aerial tissues of Arabidopsis plants, but increases their root length. THAS is part of a small operon-like cluster of genes (with At5g48000 (THAH) and At5g47990 (THAD)) involved in thalianol metabolism.

It appears to catalyze the addition of a double bond to thalian-diol at carbon 15. Reduced levels of THAD expression lead to a build up of thalian-diol in root extracts. thad1-1 mutants also have longer roots than wild type seedlings and show altered gravitropic responses.

The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO15 belongs to the clade II, with ATMLO13 and ATMLO15. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in root tips and flower (papillae, anthers and pollen grains), as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s).
