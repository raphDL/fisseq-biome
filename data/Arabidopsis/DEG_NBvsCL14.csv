Converts Trp to indo-3-acetaldoxime (IAOx), a precursor to IAA and indole glucosinolates. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.
"AT1G35140",103.216021322738,1.15145707884845,0.19846020467519,5.80195450636051,6.55463478421274e-09,1.86943646241401e-06,EXL1 is involved in the C-starvation response. Phenotypic changes of an exl1 loss of function mutant became evident only under corresponding experimental conditions. For example, the mutant showed diminished biomass production in a short-day/low light growth regime, impaired survival during extended night, and impaired survival of anoxia stress.
"AT4G35770",747.677472102697,1.28278538888288,0.251985295781167,5.09071525346817,3.56715367503502e-07,6.15224358761757e-05,Senescence-associated gene that is strongly induced by phosphate starvation.  Transcripts are differentially regulated at the level of mRNA stability at different times of day. mRNAs are targets of the mRNA degradation pathway mediated by the downstream (DST) instability determinant.

Mutants have increases in 12 seed free amino acids, accumulation of seed homomethionine and 3-isovaleroyloxypropyl-glucosinolate, with a concomitant decrease in seed 3-benzoyloxypropyl-glucosinolate. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.
